- misconception, that remote working is just about the tools - tools make only possible what has to be learned
- However: "Pretty much everybody works remote on the Spring teams. So tools like Slack, Google Hangout, Skype, E-Mail and even Twitter are essential" (from http://blog.schauderhaft.de/2017/11/12/working-spring-data-team/[Working on the Spring Data Team])

== Requirements

- __Gather those requirements together with the participants on a flip chart. Add hard- and software solutions later.__ 


- text / messaging
- voice with excellent audio
- video with good quality
- screen sharing (code review, presenting)
- knowing everyone's current status
- collaborative software development (= everything dev-related you can do with your colleagues sitting next to you in an office)
- collaborative working

== Hardware:
=== text / messaging
- multiple monitors
- your favorite keyboard (not just from notebook) - you have to be able to type really fast

=== voice
- in the office: noise-cancelling headset with adjustable microphone (not just within earphones)
- at home: (for me) microphone in notebook sufficient
- however: don't type on notebook while being un-muted because of noise

=== video
- built-in webcams these days good quality
- peripheral webcam can be moved an adjusted
- my setup: content on two screens directly in front of me + laptop screen with built-in video on the side => colleagues see me from the side, but also notice when I'm doing this vs when I'm listening to them + looking at them
- good practice: one screen just for video stream - don't minimize video stream! 
 
== Software
=== text / messaging
* company setup: Microsoft Skype for Business
* additionally https://slack.com/[Slack]-chat for
** team-wide announcements
** "over-communicating" content that might interest others
** very useful in stressful situations with a lot of spontaneous task management like right before deployment
* next step: chatbots

=== voice, video, screen share, status
- Skype OK

=== collaborative software development
* general advice: keep __everything__ digital, use proper tools
* teach whole team to communicate via comments on platforms => tech them to write properly!
* knowledge management:
** wikis like confluence (better: Atlassian toolchain)
* code reviews:
** Atlassian Bitbucket

=== collaborative working
- Skype whiteboard
- http://etherpad.org[Etherpad]
- Skype for Business: every user able to generate URL with meeting room. Usa: Declare one of those rooms as default for spontaneous meetings and keep the window open to see what's going on there and to meet quickly.

=== other
- shared calender (Outlook, Google)
- document management for ALL documents
- https://www.teamviewer.com/de/[teamview]

== How to use the tools
=== Skype

=== process
- In case of group-wide failure: have a backup communication channel (SlackChat if Skype fails) + recovery strategy ("If Skype fails to connect to our meeting room, let's meet in Slack and talk about what to do")
- In case of individual failure: for every team member, have a way to connect (best backup: telephone)
- establish a procedure for interrupts, for example ringing door bell during group conversation: write "Someone is at the door, brb" into the group-wide chat. => current speaker is not disturbed + everyone knows what's going on 
- use status messages in your messenger (Skype etc) => "Free for chat" (ICQ) vs "I'm busy" => that's not even possible in "the real world" except you put a sticker on your forehead
- establish understanding of "ping" / "pong" in messaging
