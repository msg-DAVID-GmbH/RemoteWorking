# Introduction and Meta
## Motivation for workshop
### Me
- 1h commute without possibility of remote work = lots of podcasts, but ultimately loss of lifetime
- new team. First only 1, now 3 developers in Cluj (Romania) + 2 in Germany
- two steps to "remote first thinking":
    1. internal technical problems => home office => __local separation__!
    1. thought: If I can work from anywhere, I also can work at any moment in time => working sundays => __time separation__!

### Participants
- Are you currently working in a remote team?
- If yes, in what role?
- How big is your team?
- On how many locations is your team located?
- What are your main problems?
- What are your main questions?
- What are your main concerns?
 
## About this workshop
- Participants are (kind of) trainers themselves - every team is different and something can be learned from each situation
- hence: let's learn from each other
- workshop has three ingredients:
    1. "theoretical" stuff: observations and stories regarding remote work
    1. "practical stuff": Best practices, processes & methods regarding tools
    1. cross-talk: Most of what will be mentioned is subjective and could be counter-productive in your team. Let's talk about how it could help you in your setting. 
- This workshop is NOT about if remote working is generally useful or applicable to every setting. It's about how to make it work in situations where remote is a reality or will be in the future.
