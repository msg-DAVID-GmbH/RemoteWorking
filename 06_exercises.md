# Exercises
## War Gaming: "You're remote, starting next week!"
- scenario: Your boss tells you that starting next week, your team will be split up into three different places. He wants you to work out a list with specific tasks that make this possible.
- alternation for those who are working remotely already: Your boss "sells" you as a consultant to that other team that is still working co-located. Your task is to use your vast experience to work out a list of specific tasks that migrates the other team to the new Remote-Tiger-Team.
- list of tasks has to be in chronological order
- each task rated with a priority:
    - "A" = has to be done, no matter what
    - "B" = would make things really  easier
    - "C" = nice to have
- contents of workshop shall be used
- tasks have to be team-, situational- and skill-specific to YOUR situation

### organizational
- roughly 90 minutes
- group attendees into pairs / triplets, each group should consist of members working in the same team
- 30-45 minutes creating task lists
- 10 minutes presentation of the most important milestones per group, using a projector to show whole task list + 5 minutes feedback from all attendees to presenting group = roughly 1h presentation

## Role-play: moderating a virtual meeting
- 1 moderator, up to 6 participants
- simulated daily standup meeting
- because of lack of common project: each participant describes his last vacation (3 minutes max)
- moderator: use knowledge from workshop to moderate + makes meeting last 20 minutes max 
- beforehand, each participant gets a "special task" to execute

### special tasks 
- If it's your turn, begin to speak while being muted.
- Show up 1 minute late
- "Forget" to turn on your video
- Create some kind of background noise when your team mates are speaking (crumple some paper or something) with your mic un-muted. Goal is to make the moderator mute you / tell you to mute yourself.

### organizational
- roughly 90 minutes 
- 15 minutes explanation + setup
- 30 minutes execution
- 30 minutes feedback and discussion
- needed
    - three rooms: one for moderator, one for participants of meeting, one for passive participants
    - laptop with installed Skype for every participant
